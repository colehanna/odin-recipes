            <li>2 eggs, well beaten</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir 
        in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
        until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta 
        to a slow cooker.

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 
        about 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta
        mixture.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Whisk milk and condensed soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Sprinkle remaining cheese over pasta mixture; garnish with paprika.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Cook on Low for 3 hours.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>

        Serve hot and ready!
